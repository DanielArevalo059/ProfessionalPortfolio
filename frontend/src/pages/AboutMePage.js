                        When I'm not coding, I’m celebrating life with my wonderful wife as we quickly approach our 1-year anniversary. 
                        Together, we share our home with two cats and a playful dog. Growing up in a close-knit immigrant family of six, they 
                        have always been a cornerstone of my life. This background has instilled in me a deep appreciation for family moments and 
                        the joy they bring. The sacrifices and support within my family are a source of great strength and inspiration for me. 
                        Additionally, I have a close group of friends who have become like a second family, providing unwavering support and adding even more richness to my life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of family life, I enjoy exploring new destinations, savoring diverse cuisines, and engaging in outdoor activities 
                        like disc golf and gardening. I also love soaking up the vibrant events around the Bay Area like farmer's markets, pop-up food events, and concerts. 
                        Whether it’s trying out a new restaurant or participating in a local festival, I thrive on new experiences and the joy they bring.
