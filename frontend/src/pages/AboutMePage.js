                When I'm not coding, I’m celebrating life with my wonderful wife
                as we quickly approach our 1-year anniversary. Together, we
                share our home with two cats and a playful dog. Growing up in a
                close-knit immigrant family of six, they have always been a
                cornerstone of my life. This background has instilled in me a
                deep appreciation for family moments and the joy they bring. The
                sacrifices and support within my family are a source of great
                strength and inspiration for me. Additionally, I have a close
                group of friends who have become like a second family, providing
                unwavering support and adding even more richness to my life.

                Outside of family life, I love traveling to new destinations,
                savoring diverse cuisines, and engaging in outdoor activities
                like disc golf and gardening. Although, I would be misleading
                you if I didn't mention my love for video games, binging a
                thrilling new tv show, or catching the latest horror flick at
                the movies. My wife and I also love checking out the lively
                events around the Bay Area like farmer's markets, pop-up food
                events, and concerts. I truly thrive on learning, sharing
                memories, and new experiences.

                Since childhood, I’ve always loved math and logical puzzles,
                often taking things apart and putting them back together to
                understand how they work. At Cal State East Bay, I initially
                pursued a degree in Liberal Studies and a math minor purely for
                enjoyment of the courses. In my final year, I took a Linear
                Algebra course with Professor Yap, who taught the material
                alongside Python programming. Shoutout to Professor Yap, as this
                class piqued my interest in coding, especially while I worked on
                a cryptography project that consumed my time and curiosity. The
                project scratched an itch that I never knew needed scratching.

                After college, I entered Human Resources, where I was able to
                hone my skills as a leader and a team player, but I still felt
                unfulfilled. My mind kept going back to that Linear Algebra
                class. Occasionally, I explored tech bootcamps as a way to pivot
                careers, but none seemed to be the right fit for me. A friend
                then introduced me to the Oregon State University Computer
                Science program, and after another year of deliberation, I
                finally mustered up the courage to apply.

                Accepting my offer of admission was one of the biggest decisions
                of my life, and I couldn’t be happier. The program has
                challenged me, sometimes to the point of frustration (looking at
                you, Operating Systems I,) but it reignited my passion for
                problem-solving. Now, I am thrilled to continue learning and
                growing in this ever-evolving, exhilarating, field.
