# Professional Portfolio Website

## Overview

This is the repository for my professional portfolio website, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for the frontend. The website showcases my skills, projects, and experience in software development. It is currently hosted through Render on www.daniel-arevalo.com and is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.

## Features
