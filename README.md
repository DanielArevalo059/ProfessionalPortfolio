# Professional Portfolio Website

## Overview

This is the repository for my professional portfolio website, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for the frontend. The website showcases my skills, projects, and experience in software development. It is currently hosted through Render on www.daniel-arevalo.com and is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is optimized for viewing on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Modern Frontend Stack**: Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to ensure a dynamic and interactive user experience.
- **Project Showcase**: Highlighted projects demonstrate my expertise in various technologies and frameworks.
- **No Backend (Yet)**: The current version of the website is frontend-only, but it is structured to potentially include a backend in the future.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DanielArevalo059/ProfessionalPortfolio.git
2. **Navigate to frontend:**
   cd frontend/
3. **Install Dependencies**
   npm i
4. **Start frontend**
   npm start
5. This will automatically start the fronted on http://localhost:3000

## What's Next?
In the short-term, I would like to implement a backend so that I can display a full-stack project as well as add some smaller projects that I have worked on throughout my time at Oregon State University. I am working on a contact page, so that users can send me an email form the frontend through a service like EmailJS, and I would also like to add more dynamic components to make the site more optimal, user-friendly and interactive. 

Long-term, I will be constantly updating this website throughout my career, adding to it my main projects to share with the public as well as updating my experience page to reflect job changes.
